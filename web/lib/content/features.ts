  },
  {
    title: "live CDP injection on Linux",
    body: "the Linux sink attaches to Chrome's debug port and sets cookies straight into the in-memory store, on every sync and every new browser context. no Keychain, no SQLite rewrite; browserUse, Puppeteer, and Playwright see the session already there.",
  },
  {
    title: "fan out to multiple sinks",
    body: "one source pushes the same cookies and secrets to several sinks, each sealed with that sink's own paired key. a sink that is down fails on its own while the others still receive the payload.",
  },
  {
    title: "universal cookie delivery",
    body: "one login-password entry at install (no GUI click) opens Chrome Safe Storage to any cookie reader, so unmodified tools - yt-dlp, gallery-dl, browser-driving agents, the Printing Press CLIs - read the real synced Default Chrome profile. verified live on macOS 15.x.",
  },
  {
    title: "three cookie delivery surfaces",
    body: "universal (the real Default profile + one-password keychain open) is the default; the plaintext sidecar at ~/.agentcookie/cookies-plain.db and per-CLI adapter session files are the agentcookie-aware paths that also work in degraded mode.",
  },
  {
    title: "works with Printing Press CLIs like",
    body: "Stripe, Linear, Notion, Granola, Slack, Kalshi, ElevenLabs, Mercury, and dozens more - anything with a bearer token or API key reads the secrets bus. Five (instacart, airbnb, ebay, pagliacci, table-reservation-goat) additionally get a bespoke cookie adapter.",
  },
  {
    title: "per-CLI secrets bus",
    body: "bearer tokens, API keys, KEY=VALUE auth blobs ride the same encrypted push and land at ~/.agentcookie/secrets/<cli>/secrets.env (mode 0600) with an optional sealed twin.",
  },
  {
    title: "v2 adoption standard",
    body: "drop an agentcookie.toml in your repo and agentcookie discover auto-detects it. three integration tiers (explicit, pp-cli-derived, legacy v1) coexist.",

    title: "tailnet-only listeners",
    body: "both ends bind tailnet-private addresses. pair endpoint is rate-limited with a 64-bit code.",

    title: "Apple Developer ID signed",
    body: "every release binary signed and timestamped. the sink daemon reads Chrome Safe Storage via the teamid: partition - no per-binary trust list, no recreate of the key value, no AllowAlways prompt after install.",
